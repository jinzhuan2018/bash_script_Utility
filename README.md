# General guide
After you download a bash script,and you may need to grant the script 'run' permission. To do this, you can type: <br>
$ chmod 755 script.sh <br>. In the following, I use 'script.sh' for my short-handed notation.


# File description

then it will pop up the found files and the corresponding lines. <br>
It wait a user to confirm, then string1 is replaced by string2. <br>
You can freely change the script name. <br>
